# Sandwich Maker

## Description
This application allows a user to select items for a custom sandwich.  The user will choose the options they would like to include for their sandwich then click a button to print their order below with the total for the sandwich.  The order form is set to default where no option is selected.  Validation is set so you can only choose one bread option but you can choose multiple topping options.  If you select "none" on any of the groups it will clear your previous selections.

## Features
- Uses ES6 Modules to keep components separate
- Custom buttons with validation set with javascript
